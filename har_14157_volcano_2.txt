VOLCANO HAZARD ASSESSMENT

All hazard assessments are based on the latest available hazard maps and on the location indicated in the vicinity map provided.

EXPLANATION AND RECOMMENDATION

1. Kanlaon Volcano is the nearest identified active volcano to the site.

2. In case of future eruptions of Kanlaon Volcano and other nearby volcanoes, the site/s may be affected by tephra fall/ ashfall depending on the height of the eruption plume and prevailing wind direction at the time of eruption. Generally, tephra fall/ ashfall is thicker near the eruption center and thins away from the volcano. Ash can cause widespread infrastructural, agricultural, and property damages, and negative health impacts.

This assessment supersedes all previous reports issued for this site.
