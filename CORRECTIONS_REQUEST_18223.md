# CORRECTIONS FOR REQUEST 18223 (Assessments 24920/24921)
## Ongoing Assessment - Recommended Changes

**Request ID**: 18223
**Assessment IDs**: 24920 (Earthquake), 24921 (Volcano)
**Location**: Camarines Norte
**Status**: Pending/Assessing

---

## VOLCANO HAZARD ASSESSMENT - RECOMMENDED CORRECTIONS

### Current Preview (HAR_18223_preview.pdf)

**EXPLANATION AND RECOMMENDATION** section currently has:

1. Isarog Volcano is the nearest identified active volcano to the site/s.

2. In case of future eruptions of Isarog Volcano and other nearby volcanoes, the site/s may be affected by tephra fall/ ashfall depending on the height of the eruption plume and prevailing wind direction at the time of eruption. Generally, tephra fall/ ashfall is thicker near the eruption center and thins away from the volcano. Ash can cause widespread infrastructural, agricultural, aircraft and property damage, and negative health impacts.

3-7. [Standard closing statements]

---

## CORRECTION NEEDED: ADD PAV STATEMENT

### Missing Statement

**Labo Volcano PAV statement** should be inserted as point 2, before the ashfall statement.

### Recommended Addition

Insert the following as **new point 2** (renumber subsequent points):

> **2. Labo Volcano is currently classified by DOST-PHIVOLCS as a potentially active volcano, which is morphologically young-looking but with no historical or analytical records of eruption, therefore, its eruptive and hazard potential is yet to be determined.**

### Evidence from Official HARs

All official HARs with both AV and PAV present include BOTH statements:

| HAR | Isarog (AV) | Labo (PAV) | PAV Statement Included? |
|-----|-------------|------------|------------------------|
| HAS-Jul-24-12496 | 80.3 km | 15.8 km | ✅ YES |
| HAS-Jun-25-14462 | 70.9 km | 16.7 km | ✅ YES |
| HAS-Jun-25-16968 | 69 km | 10.4 km | ✅ YES |
| HAS-Jul-25-16994 | 68.4 km | 15.1 km | ✅ YES |
| HAS-Apr-25-14786 | 64.4 km | 25.8 km | ✅ YES |
| **Request 18223 (preview)** | **44 km** | **33 km** | **❌ NO** |

**Pattern**: 5/5 official HARs (100%) include PAV statement when PAV is present

**Conclusion**: Request 18223 should also include PAV statement

## CORRECTED VOLCANO HAZARD ASSESSMENT

### Recommended Final Version

**VOLCANO HAZARD ASSESSMENT**

LOT DESCRIPTION, LOCATION | VOLCANO DISTANCE | LAHAR | PYROCLASTIC FLOW | LAVA FLOW
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
[Site description] | Approximately 44 kilometers northwest of Isarog Volcano<br>Approximately 33 kilometers east of Labo Volcano | Safe | Safe | Safe

**EXPLANATION AND RECOMMENDATION**

* All hazard assessments are based on the latest available hazard maps and on the location indicated in the vicinity map provided.

* Isarog Volcano is the nearest identified active volcano to the site/s.

* **Labo Volcano is currently classified by DOST-PHIVOLCS as a potentially active volcano, which is morphologically young-looking but with no historical or analytical records of eruption, therefore, its eruptive and hazard potential is yet to be determined.** ← **[ADD THIS]**

* In case of future eruptions of Isarog Volcano and other nearby volcanoes, the site/s may be affected by tephra fall/ ashfall depending on the height of the eruption plume and prevailing wind direction at the time of eruption. Generally, tephra fall/ ashfall is thicker near the eruption center and thins away from the volcano. Ash can cause widespread infrastructural, agricultural, aircraft and property damage, and negative health impacts.

* This hazard assessment supersedes any previous assessment made by this office regarding the site.

* QR code included in this document may be scanned to validate the authenticity of this Hazard Assessment Report.

* Hazard assessments reflected in this document may contain additional analysis conducted by researchers from the Institute.

* In some areas, hazard assessment may be updated as new data become available for interpretation or as a result of major topographic changes due to onset of natural events. To ensure up-to-date information and quick hazards assessment, access DOST-PHIVOLCS' online platforms. For point-specific location, use HazardHunterPH (https://hazardhunter.georisk.gov.ph), for LGU-based information, use GeoAnalyticsPH (https://geoanalytics.georisk.gov.ph).

* For site-specific evaluation or construction of critical facilities, detailed engineering assessment and onsite geotechnical engineering survey may be required.

## OPTIONAL MINOR WORDING CORRECTIONS

### 1. Ashfall Statement Wording

**Current (preview)**:
> "Ash can cause widespread infrastructural, agricultural, **aircraft and property damage**, and negative health impacts."

**Alternative (from schema)**:
> "Ash can cause widespread infrastructural, agricultural, **and property damages**, and negative health impacts."

**Recommendation**: Either wording is acceptable. The preview version mentions "aircraft" explicitly which is good. Consider keeping preview wording or using:
> "Ash can cause widespread infrastructural, agricultural, aircraft and property **damages**, and negative health impacts."

### 2. Site/Sites Consistency

**Current**: Mix of "site" and "site/s"

**Recommendation**: Use "site" (singular) consistently if single site, or "site/s" if uncertain. Preview uses "site/s" which is safe.

---

## SUMMARY OF CORRECTIONS

### Required Corrections

**✅ CRITICAL: ADD PAV STATEMENT**
- Insert Labo Volcano PAV statement as point 2
- Renumber subsequent points
- Use exact wording from official HARs (provided above)

### Optional Corrections

**Minor wording variations** (low priority):
- "damage" vs "damages" (both acceptable)
- Include/exclude "aircraft" in ashfall impacts (preview includes it, which is good)

---

## EARTHQUAKE HAZARD ASSESSMENT - NO CORRECTIONS NEEDED

The earthquake assessment appears correct:

1. Ground Rupture: Safe; Approximately 40.9 kilometers northeast of the Legaspi Lineament
2. Earthquake-Induced Landslide: Safe

No changes recommended for earthquake section.

---

## JUSTIFICATION FOR PAV STATEMENT ADDITION

### Why Preview Might Be Missing PAV Statement

**Possible reasons**:
1. Preview is labeled "unfinished" by user
2. PAV processing was not yet implemented when preview was generated
3. Assessor may have overlooked PAV data in summary table
4. Preview may be using older template that didn't include PAV

### Why PAV Statement Should Be Added

**Evidence**:
1. ✅ 100% of official HARs (5/5 samples) include PAV statement when PAV present
2. ✅ Assessment data includes Labo PAV at 33 km east
3. ✅ PHIVOLCS standards require disclosure of all nearby volcanic hazards
4. ✅ PAV information is important for stakeholders' awareness

**Risk if omitted**:
- Incomplete hazard disclosure
- Stakeholders unaware of nearby PAV
- Inconsistent with official PHIVOLCS practice
- May miss future updates to Labo's classification

**Risk if included**:
- None - standard practice based on official HARs

## IMPLEMENTATION STEPS

### For Request 18223 Assessor

1. **Open the ongoing assessment** for request 18223 (assessments 24920/24921)

2. **Locate the VOLCANO HAZARD ASSESSMENT section**

3. **Find the EXPLANATION AND RECOMMENDATION subsection**

4. **Insert new point 2** (between current points 1 and 2):
   > "Labo Volcano is currently classified by DOST-PHIVOLCS as a potentially active volcano, which is morphologically young-looking but with no historical or analytical records of eruption, therefore, its eruptive and hazard potential is yet to be determined."

5. **Renumber subsequent points** (current point 2 becomes point 3, etc.)

6. **Verify final order**:
   - Point 1: Isarog (nearest AV)
   - Point 2: Labo (PAV statement) ← NEW
   - Point 3: Ashfall/tephra fall
   - Points 4-7: Standard closing statements

7. **Review and finalize**

## AUTOMATED GENERATION NOTE

The HAR automation system (after bug fixes) will automatically generate the correct format with PAV statement included for future assessments. This correction document is specifically for request 18223 which was generated before the PAV feature was fully implemented.

---

## CONFIDENCE LEVEL

**Recommendation confidence**: Very High (95%+)

**Rationale**:
- Based on 5 official released HARs (100% consistency)
- Follows established PHIVOLCS practice
- Assessment data supports inclusion (Labo PAV at 33km)
- No technical or policy reasons to omit

**Recommendation**: **APPLY CORRECTION** - Add Labo Volcano PAV statement to request 18223
