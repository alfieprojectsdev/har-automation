VOLCANO HAZARD ASSESSMENT

All hazard assessments are based on the latest available hazard maps and on the location indicated in the vicinity map provided.

EXPLANATION AND RECOMMENDATION

1. Isarog Volcano is the nearest identified active volcano to the site.

2. Labo Volcano is currently classified by DOST-PHIVOLCS as a potentially active volcano, which is morphologically young-looking but with no historical or analytical records of eruption, therefore, its eruptive and hazard potential is yet to be determined.

3. In case of future eruptions of Isarog Volcano and other nearby volcanoes, the site/s may be affected by tephra fall/ ashfall depending on the height of the eruption plume and prevailing wind direction at the time of eruption. Generally, tephra fall/ ashfall is thicker near the eruption center and thins away from the volcano. Ash can cause widespread infrastructural, agricultural, and property damages, and negative health impacts.

This assessment supersedes all previous reports issued for this site.
