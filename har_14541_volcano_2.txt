VOLCANO HAZARD ASSESSMENT

All hazard assessments are based on the latest available hazard maps and on the location indicated in the vicinity map provided.

EXPLANATION AND RECOMMENDATION

1. Camiguin de Babuyanes Volcano is the nearest identified active volcano to the site.

2. Considering the distance of the site from the volcano, the site is safe from volcanic hazards such as pyroclastic density currents, lava flows, and ballistic projectiles that may originate from the volcano.

3. In case of future eruptions of Camiguin de Babuyanes Volcano and other nearby volcanoes, the site/s may be affected by tephra fall/ ashfall depending on the height of the eruption plume and prevailing wind direction at the time of eruption. Generally, tephra fall/ ashfall is thicker near the eruption center and thins away from the volcano. Ash can cause widespread infrastructural, agricultural, and property damages, and negative health impacts.

This assessment supersedes all previous reports issued for this site.
