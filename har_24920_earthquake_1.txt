EARTHQUAKE HAZARD ASSESSMENT

All hazard assessments are based on the latest available hazard maps and on the location indicated in the vicinity map provided.

EXPLANATION AND RECOMMENDATION

1. Ground Rupture: Safe; Approximately 40.9 kilometers northeast of the Legaspi Lineament. Ground rupture hazard assessment is the distance to the nearest known active fault. The recommended buffer zone, or Zone of Avoidance, against ground rupture hazard is at least 5 meters on both sides of the active fault or from its zone of deformation.

2. Earthquake-Induced Landslide: Safe. Avoidance is recommended for sites with earthquake-induced landslide hazard unless appropriate engineering interventions are in place.

This assessment supersedes all previous reports issued for this site.
